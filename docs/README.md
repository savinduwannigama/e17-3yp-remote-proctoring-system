## PROBLEM STATEMENT

When conducting examinations where the skills of the students in a limited timeframe, it's crucial to manage the external factors affecting the performance of the students at a satisfactory level. 
However it could be challenging to manage these factors in an online environment.

## SOLUTION
##### ***REMOTE PROCTORING DEVICE***
We have come up with a single device which integrates the hardware and software components needed to conduct an examination in the currently implemented system, which will provide a seamless process for the proctors and students involved in an examination.

#### ***REMOTE DEVICE***


## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

![system](./assets/img/system/oursystem.PNG)

The device on the student's side is capable of capturing the video and audio stream from students continuously even incase of a power failure.
The proctor will be able to monitor the video and audio streams captured from all the students facing an examination through the browser application in the proctor's side.


##### ***HIGH-LEVEL SYSTEM OVERVIEW***
![overview](./assets/img/system/system.PNG)

The system consists of three main endpoints.

* Web browser in Proctor's end
* Desktop application in Student's end
* Database and server application hosted on the Cloud
* Method used to ensure secure video/audio streaming:

HTTPS protects the user from so-called “man-in-the-middle” attacks where hackers can use vulnerabilities in these public networks to steal data as it’s being transmitted to the viewer. using HLS encryption to mask a users’ connection with the website and prevents this sort of attack.
